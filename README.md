**QEDprocesses.jl** is a Julia package for modeling scattering processes in quantum electrodynamics (QED).
It is part of the [`QuantumElectrodynamics.jl`](https://qedjl-project.github.io/QuantumElectrodynamics.jl/dev/) ecosystem,
which provides a modular framework for simulating QED interactions.

For details on how this package integrates with the rest of the `QuantumElectrodynamics.jl` ecosystem,
see the [QuantumElectrodynamics.jl documentation](https://qedjl-project.github.io/QuantumElectrodynamics.jl/dev/).

## Installation

To install the latest stable release of `QEDprocesses.jl`, use Julia's package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("QEDprocesses")
```

Alternatively, in the Pkg prompt (accessed by pressing `]` in the Julia REPL):

```julia
(@v1.10) pkg> add QEDprocesses
```

To install a locally downloaded version of the package (e.g., on Windows), navigate to the parent directory and run:

```julia
(@v1.10) pkg> add ./QEDprocesses.jl
```
